# Prompt Phase 2 Handoff

## Summary of Tasks 1-4
- **TASK-101**: Bootstrapped the Vite + React + TypeScript workspace with Cloudflare Worker integration, Tailwind, and routing scaffolding.
- **TASK-102**: Established the shadcn/ui design system, including theming, dark mode, and composite recipe showcase components.
- **TASK-103**: Implemented the auth-ready data layerâ€”centralized API client with token refresh, TanStack Query provider, Zustand auth store with session persistence, auth hooks/UI, and Cloudflare Worker auth mocks.
- **TASK-104**: Delivered the React Router app shell with lazy-loaded feature routes, TanStack Query-powered route prefetching, WCAG-labelled desktop navigation, and a mobile sheet experience built from shadcn primitives.

## Current Project State
- React SPA builds and lints cleanly (`npm run lint`, `npm run build`).
- Application shell now includes responsive navigation with TanStack Query prefetching, hover/focus/touch hints, and accessible labelling that mirrors the desktop and mobile patterns.
- Feature routes (chat, kitchen hub, recipes, planner) render inside the shared shell using suspense-driven skeleton fallbacks and simulated data fetchers.
- Zustand store persists tokens in `sessionStorage`, auto-refreshes tokens, and keeps query cache synchronized.
- Cloudflare Worker serves `/api/health` and `/api/auth/{login,refresh,me}` mock endpoints mirroring expected JSON contracts.
- Documentation updated to reflect the new authentication/query/navigation layer.

## Recommended Next Steps (Phase 3)
1. **TASK-201**: Build the "My Kitchen" appliance list UI, hooking TanStack Query to Worker mocks for CRUD operations and multipart uploads.
2. Expand Worker mocks for kitchen/recipe endpoints to unblock UI development.
3. Add integration tests covering navigation, login/logout, and token refresh flows (Vitest + Testing Library).
4. Evaluate toast deduplication and query error UX once more endpoints exist.

## Ready-to-Use Prompt for Next Phase
```
Open project_tasks.json and continue with TASK-201.
- Build the Smart Kitchen Hub appliance list UI with shadcn cards, dialogs, and progress indicators.
- Wire TanStack Query hooks to new Worker mocks for listing, creating, and deleting appliances (including multipart uploads for manuals).
- Ensure optimistic updates keep the UI responsive and WCAG-compliant during mutations.
- Update README, project_tasks.json (status, notes, date), and PROMPT_PHASE_3.md when TASK-201 is complete.
- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `wrangler deploy --dry-run` before committing.
- Capture updated screenshots demonstrating the kitchen hub experience.
```

## Technical Decisions & Patterns
- **API Client**: All HTTP requests flow through `src/lib/api.ts`, which handles JSON parsing, auth headers, and token refresh with exponential guard against infinite retries.
- **State Management**: `src/stores/useAuthStore.ts` persists session tokens in `sessionStorage`, rehydrates status automatically, and exposes selector helpers for components/hooks.
- **Data Fetching**: `src/lib/queryClient.ts` centralizes TanStack Query defaults (stale times, retry policy, toast-based error reporting).
- **Auth Hooks**: `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` composes the API client and store to expose `useLogin`, `useLogout`, and `useCurrentUser` hooks with React Query caching.
- **Mock Backend**: `worker/index.ts` simulates realistic auth flows, encoding user identity in mock tokens so `/auth/me` and `/auth/refresh` return consistent identities.
