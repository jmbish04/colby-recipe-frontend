# Prompt Phase 3 Handoff

## Summary of TASK-201 (Smart Kitchen Hub)
- Delivered the shadcn-powered **My Kitchen** appliance manager with responsive cards, dialogs, and alert dialogs that meet WCAG 2.1 AA for keyboard, focus, and aria labelling.
- Wired TanStack Query hooks for listing, creating (multipart upload), and deleting appliances with optimistic cache updates, simulated upload progress, and background polling while manuals process.
- Added refined toast deduplication so repeated success/error states do not spam the user while still surfacing actionable feedback.
- Extended the Cloudflare Worker mock to support `/api/kitchen/appliances` CRUD with multipart validation, delayed processing, and generated manual URLs.
- Authored Vitest + Testing Library integration coverage that exercises loading, creation, and deletion flows, ensuring the optimistic UX remains stable.

## Updated Artifacts
- UI: `src/routes/kitchen-hub.tsx`
- Data hooks: `src/hooks/useAppliances.ts`
- Toast utilities: `src/lib/toast.ts`
- Worker mocks: `worker/index.ts`
- Tests: `src/routes/__tests__/kitchen-hub.test.tsx`
- Documentation: `README.md`, `project_tasks.json`, and this prompt file

## Quality Gates
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run build`
- `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run`

(See the PR description for command output and screenshot artifacts.)

## Next Steps (Phase 4)
1. Kick off **TASK-202** to implement asynchronous manual processing UI with conditional polling, explicit error handling, and completion toasts.
2. Expand Worker mocks/tests as needed to represent manual status transitions and retry paths.
3. Continue replacing simulated `routeData` fetchers with production-ready TanStack Query hooks as endpoints are mocked.
4. Use the new `PROMPT_PHASE_4.md` handoff prompt for onboarding the next assignee.
